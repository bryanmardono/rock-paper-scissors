# TOP Project : Rock Paper Scissors
My first bonafide project from The Odin Project curriculum

## First Stage | Game Implementation through Browser Console
Benefits I gained from building this stage:
* Deeper knowledge of how functions work in conjunction with each other
* Understanding the use of switch case instead of if else
* Learned how to color console text
